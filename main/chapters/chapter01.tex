\begin{theorem}
There is no rational number whose square is 2 \\
\textit{Proof.} A rational number can be expressed as $ p/q $ where both $ p $ and $ q $ are integers. We can prove this using contradiction. If there does exist a rational number whose square is 2, then $$ \left(\dfrac{p}{q}\right)^2 = 2$$ We can rearrange this to find that \[ p^2 = 2 q^2 \]. Based on this, we know that $ p^2 $ is even. We must now show that since $ p^2 $ is even $ p $ must also be even. Here we can say that since $ p^2 = p * p $ and $ p^2 $ is divisible by 2, $ p $ must also be divisible by two, since $ p $ is an integer. We can now introduce another variable $ a $ to say $ 2a = p $ so \[ \dfrac{4a^2}{q^2} = 2 \] rearranging we find 
\[ \dfrac{q^2}{a^2} = 2 \] now using the previous argument we know that $ q $ is also even. This now tells us that $ p/q $ is further divisible and thus does not define a rational number.
